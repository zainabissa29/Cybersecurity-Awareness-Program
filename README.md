## 📋 Executive Summary

This repository presents a comprehensive, end-to-end **Cybersecurity Awareness & Social Engineering Resilience Program**, simulating how a cybersecurity analyst designs, implements, and measures an enterprise-wide awareness initiative.  

It is structured around the **NIST SP 800-50** framework and aligned with **ISO/IEC 27001 A.7.2.2**, demonstrating governance, training, and continuous improvement for organizations — particularly those operating in **Operational Technology (OT) and SCADA environments**.

> 💡 *Objective:* Transform employees from potential vulnerabilities into active defenders through measurable, data-driven awareness and behavior reinforcement.

## ⚠️ The Challenge

- 🔴 **73% phishing click rate** across the organization  
- 🟠 No structured security awareness or communication plan  
- 🔴 Failed ISO 27001 audit on A.7.2.2 awareness control  
- 🟠 Multiple social engineering incidents impacting finance and OT systems  

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Assess awareness maturity and risk exposure through surveys and simulations.  
- Develop policies, stakeholder engagement strategies, and governance frameworks.  
- Deliver engaging, role-based training across all departments.  
- Measure improvement using defined **KPIs, dashboards, and risk heatmaps**.  
- Institutionalize continuous learning through quarterly program reviews.

## 🧭 Implementation Phases

### 🧩 Phase 1 — Survey & Assessment
- Conducted 20-question employee awareness survey.  
- Ran baseline phishing simulation (73% click rate).  
- Mapped departmental risk heatmaps (Finance, Executives, OT critical).  
- Performed NIST SP 800-50 gap analysis.

</p>
---

### 🏗️ Phase 2 — Program Design
- Developed **Cybersecurity Awareness Policy v1.0** and training governance.  
- Created Communication Plan and annual Awareness Calendar.  
- Built executive business case with ROI justification and board approval.  

| Role | Core Training | Specialized Training | Phishing Frequency |
|------|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| All Staff | 2 hrs | - | Monthly |
| Finance | 2 hrs | +1 hr (BEC) | Bi-weekly |
| Executives | 2 hrs | +30 min (Whaling) | Monthly |
| OT Staff | 2 hrs | +1 hr (ICS) | Monthly |

---

### 🎓 Phase 3 — Training & Implementation
- Launched 4-module awareness program (Essentials, Email, Access, Physical).  
- Created role-based simulations and phishing campaigns.  
- Distributed security posters, newsletters, and gamified leaderboards.

| Campaign | Difficulty | Click Rate | Report Rate |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Baseline | Easy | 73% 🔴 | 4% 🔴 |
| Post-Training | Medium | 22% 🟠 | 38% 🟠 |
| Advanced | Hard | 14% 🟠 | 52% 🟢 |
| Final | Medium | 8% 🟢 | 67% 🟢 |

---

### 📊 Phase 4 — Metrics & Reporting
- Built Power BI dashboards to visualize KPI trends.  
- Conducted quarterly reports with executive presentations.  
- Aligned metrics with awareness maturity model and audit requirements.

| KPI | Target | Achieved |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Phishing Click Rate | ≤ 10% | 8% ✅ |
| Report Rate | ≥ 60% | 67% ✅ |
| Training Completion | ≥ 95% | 98% ✅ |
| Resilience Score | ≥ 50% | 59% ✅ |

---

### 🔁 Phase 5 — Continuous Improvement
- Quarterly reviews and annual NIST-aligned reassessments.  
- Updated training for emerging threats (QR code phishing, MFA fatigue).  
- Developed peer-based “Security Champion” program.
